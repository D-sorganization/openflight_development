"""Club path directional separation report.

Club path has no ground truth at a home range, so acceptance is separation
between deliberate swing groups rather than an accuracy figure. Run three
sessions -- in-to-out, square, out-to-in -- and pass their JSONLs here.

Usage:
    uv run python scripts/iwr6843/club_path_report.py \

        --square     session_B.jsonl \
