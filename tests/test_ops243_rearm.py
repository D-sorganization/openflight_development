"""Re-arm must not hang when the radar streams bytes continuously.

Reproduces the field failure where the OPS243 never presents a 200 ms
quiet gap after a capture (continuous dumps or streaming-mode fallback):
rearm_rolling_buffer's drain loop had no timeout, so the monitor thread
hung silently and the radar was never re-armed (blue dump light stays on).
