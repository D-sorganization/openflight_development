      underlying score earns, failing the upper bound -- corroboration has to
      be worth something.
    - base -> 1.0 overshoots that same upper bound.

    These are bounds, not a lock on the value: any base in roughly (0.0, 0.625)
    still passes. That is deliberate. The honest requirement is the *ordering* --
    a measured single-channel angle beats the table fallback, and corroboration
